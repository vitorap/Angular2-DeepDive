# Alert Project

## Overview

The `alert-project` is a hands-on Angular practice project focused on mastering Angular components. This project includes the implementation of two custom components, `WarningAlert` and `SuccessAlert`, designed to provide a practical understanding of Angular's component architecture, styling, and templates.

## Why This Project?

The primary goal of this project was to gain practical experience with Angular, particularly in:

- Creating and integrating custom components.
- Exploring different types of component selectors.
- Applying custom styles to components, experimenting with a retro 8-bit theme.
- Learning to use external fonts and style encapsulation in Angular.

## Experimentation and Results

During the development of this project, we experimented with various aspects of Angular components:

### Components Created

- **WarningAlert**: A component displaying a warning message styled with a retro 8-bit aesthetic.
- **SuccessAlert**: A similar component for success messages, maintaining the retro theme.

### Styling

- We used the "VT323" font from Google Fonts to achieve the retro, pixelated look.
- Custom CSS was applied to create a distinctive 8-bit style with red and green backgrounds for warning and success messages, respectively.
- Experimented with CSS features like `:hover` to enhance interactivity.

### Challenges and Learning

- Understanding the importance of proper component declaration and module integration in Angular.
- Overcoming initial difficulties with CSS application and selector specificity.
- Gaining insights into the flexibility and power of Angular's styling encapsulation.

## How to Run the Project

To run the `alert-project`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Execute `ng serve` to start the development server.
5. Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

## Future Improvements

While the project met its initial educational objectives, future enhancements can include:

- Adding more complex component interactions.
- Exploring advanced Angular features like services and routing.
- Integrating unit tests for component testing.
